Create a modern, animated HTML website for a memecoin called ElmoFi ($ELMOFI), inspired by the structure of  @dogogogo.html 

⚠️ DO NOT copy the text or design. Just use similar structure, layout, and UX flow.
🧱 Structure:
1. **Header Bar (Fixed):**
   - Logo on the left (logo.png)
   - Navigation links on the right:
     - “Why ElmoFi?”
     - “Roadmap”
     - “The Legend”
     - “Buy $ELMOFI”
2. **Hero Section:**
   - Fullscreen banner background (banner.png)
   - Big centered logo and heading: “Welcome to ElmoFi”
   - Animated subtitle: “Glitch-born. Meme-powered.”
   - Large CTA button: “BUY ON PUMPFUN” (https://pump.fun)
3. **What is ElmoFi Section:**
   - Side-by-side layout
   - Left: image (1.png)
   - Right: heading + paragraph describing ElmoFi as a digital entity born from corrupted AI and chaos algorithms
4. **Step-by-step Onboarding (Like Doge wallet cards):**
   - 3 columns:
     - “Step 1: Open your third eye”
     - “Step 2: Touch lava”
     - “Step 3: Click ‘BUY’ and don’t ask questions”
   - Add hover animations (bounce, glow, tilt)
5. **Gallery Grid (Use 2.png–5.png):**
   - Show each image in a card
   - Under each image — a meme-caption like:
     - 2.png: “This is Elmo’s real face after he saw your sell order.”
     - 3.png: “ElmoFi isn’t safe. That’s why it pumps.”
     - 4.png: “We tried to contain him. We failed.”
     - 5.png: “You’re either with the lava, or under it.”
6. **Roadmap:**
   - Vertical or horizontal timeline
   - Stylized like Dogecoin’s Trailmap
   - Example milestones:
     - Q1: Launch on pump.fun
     - Q2: Elmo becomes self-aware
     - Q3: Chaos. Fire. Pump.
     - Q4: Merch? Maybe.
7. **Legend Button:**
   - When clicked, opens a dark overlay or section with animated paragraphs describing how ElmoFi was born from a corrupted TikTok filter and now lives inside pump.fun
8. **Animated background:**
   - Use fon.png as repeating background or blur-layer
   - Add floating red blobs or flames using CSS
9. **Footer:**
   - Logo again
   - Short text like: “ElmoFi is not responsible for your financial decisions. But it is watching.”
   - Small social links placeholders (Twitter, Pump)
🎨 Style:
- Use font-family: ‘Comic Neue’, ‘Bebas Neue’
- Colors: red, black, bright green, cream background areas
- AOS or keyframe animations: fade, scale, wobble, bounce
- Responsive, but optimized for desktop wow-effect
Make it fun, unpredictable, readable. All text must be editable.
Use clean HTML/CSS/JS — no Bootstrap.
